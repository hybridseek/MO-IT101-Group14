INSTRUCTIONS,,,,,,,,,
"Use the guide below to help you fill out this template.

TASK # - Use  whole numbers to specify main tasks (e.g., 1,2,3). If the task is considered a sub-task, advance the numbering using decimal points to still identify what the main task is (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3).

TASK - Describe the task. Start tasks with verbs/action words to add specificity, e.g., List requirements instead of simply Requirements.

DEPENDENCY - Identify the task which cannot be started unless a previous task has been completed. Leave this blank if there is no dependency.

OWNER - Identify the person responsible for completing the task.

START DATE & END DATE - Identify the planned start and end dates per task. The main task's start and end-date should be the start date of the first sub-task and the end date of the last sub-task. The last end date in your project plan should be within the submission dates indicated in your syllabus.

STATUS - By default, all tasks start with a Not Started status. Change the status to In Progress if it's already being worked on and Completed once the task is done.

ACTUAL START & END DATE - Specify the actual start and end dates per task. This allows you to identify whether you were able to adhere to your initial timelines and if you will be able to complete the rest of your tasks on time. If you see that you don't have sufficient time, you need to work with your team to decide on alternatives or adjustments.

NOTES - Indicate any notes or reminders you may have for each task. ",,,,,,,,,
