| #  | GUIDE QUESTIONS | ANSWER (Write your answer to the guide question based on your current understanding) | ITEMS FOR CLARIFICATION (Identify items you need to clarify with your mentor) |
|----|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | What problem is the client trying to resolve or what business need are they trying to fulfill? | The client wants to streamline their payroll system by automating employee details management, salary calculation, and deductions. | Are there specific pain points with their current system that need to be addressed? |
| 2  | What are your assumptions about the requirement? | The client requires a phased approach, starting with payroll automation. They want a user-friendly interface and accurate calculation of salaries, including grace periods and government deductions. | Do they prefer a specific platform or programming language for implementation? |
| 3  | What is the end goal for completing this? | To deliver a fully automated payroll system that accurately calculates salaries, manages employee records, and complies with government regulations. | Are there plans to integrate this system with inventory management in future phases? |
| 4  | What features are the client looking for? | - Employee details display.  - Weekly hours worked calculation.  - Gross and net salary computation.  - Grace period for log-ins. | Will the system eventually need to support additional features like tax filing or benefits management? |
| 5  | Are the features part of a process? If yes, what are the steps? | Yes, the steps are: 1. Log employee details. 2. Track work hours and grace period. 3. Calculate gross salary. 4. Deduct government-mandated contributions. 5. Present net salary. | How will the client provide initial employee details and log data (manual upload or real-time tracking)? |
| 6  | Do you have thoughts on how this feature can be developed differently? | Using Java, this feature can be developed as a modular application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. | Is the client open to adopting modern technology for a more scalable solution? |
| 7  | How will you know that the requirements have been completed? | The requirements will be considered completed when: - Employee details (employee number, name, birthday) are displayed correctly. - The hours worked are calculated correctly, considering the grace period. - Gross salary is computed based on the correct number of hours worked. - Net salary is calculated correctly after deductions are applied. - All output is clearly presented in the console in a readable format with no errors. - Testing in weeks 9-10 confirms that all calculations are accurate and matched. | Will the client provide a specific set of test cases for validation? |
| 8  | Where does the process start? What happens next? | The process begins with retrieving the employee data (name, number, birthday) and time logs (login and log-out times) from the provided data source (e.g., Google Sheets or CSV file). 1. Retrieve and display employee details. 2. Calculate hours worked based on login/logout times and apply the grace period rule. 3. Calculate the gross salary by multiplying the hours worked with the hourly rate. 4. Apply government deductions as per the matrix. 5. Calculate the net salary by subtracting deductions from the gross salary. 6. Finally, display all the results in the console in a structured format for each employee. | Should the system notify employees of their pay slips or log them in a portal? |
| 9  | Where will the results be displayed? | The results will be displayed directly in the console. Each employee's details (name, number, birthday), hours worked, gross salary, deductions, and net salary will be printed in a clear and formatted output, allowing the user to easily verify the payroll information. | Does the client prefer any specific format for displaying or exporting payroll reports? |
| 10 | What details or information do you need to know so you can initiate the task? | - Access to the employee database. - Government deduction rates. - Clarification on grace period rules. - Preferred programming tools and platforms. | Are there additional details on how log-in times are recorded and validated? |
| 11 | Are there alternative scenarios that you can think of? | An alternative is implementing biometric log-in systems to eliminate manual tracking and further improve accuracy in timekeeping and salary calculations. | Would the client consider integrating a timekeeping device like a fingerprint scanner? |
| 12 | What are the tasks that need to be tracked? | - Visualization approval. - Employee details functionality. - Hours and salary calculation modules. - Deduction and net salary computation. - Testing and bug fixing. | Who will be responsible for tracking and approving each deliverable? |
| 13 | Do the features indicated by the client meet their current need or solve the problem they're trying to solve? | Yes, the proposed features address the basic payroll processing needs and comply with government requirements while setting the foundation for future enhancements like inventory integration. | Are there other unmet needs or potential issues that the client anticipates? |
